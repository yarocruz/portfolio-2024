It was created by Sam Kass and Karen Bryla, but it was popularized in an episode of the Big Bang Theory called The Lizard-Spock expansion. I built it to learn more about the Vue.js library and to learn the basics of game logic.",

According to the research, the average reading speed is around 250 words per minute. I did the math and that's about 4.5 words a minute, which is 1 word every 250 milliseconds. That last piece of math I'm not so sure.",
