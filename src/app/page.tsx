        <p className="xl:w-10/12">I‚Äôm a Software Engineer based in Orlando, FL. My main domain has been in
        Web Development, but I‚Äôm interested in the broader world of Programming. 
        I studied Graphic Design and specialized in Web Design. I also completed
        a ‚ÄúFull-Stack‚Äù JavaScript centered Coding Bootcamp. I did a short gig with a Startup
        as a Front-End Developer, worked in Tech Support for ServiceNow, and I‚Äôm currently a 
        Teaching Assistant for the 2U/edX Coding Bootcamps.</p>
        {/* <p className="lg:w-10/12">Besides Programming, I have always had an interest in writing. My first career and college 
          degree pursuit was in Journalism, but that only lasted one semester. Also, while I was 
          studying Graphic and Web Design, I got into Photography and got pretty decent at it. At least 
          decent enough to land a job in a theme park as a photographer.</p> */}
